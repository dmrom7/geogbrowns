abstract: Right-wing variants of populism are on the rise across the globe, creating new patterns of interaction between society and the environment. These new socio-ecological relationships – dubbed “populist ecologies” – are not homogenous and, instead, can vary from country to country and populist to populist. In this paper, we adopt two illustrative case studies to outline two particular right-wing populist ecologies. First, we turn to the government of Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil (2019 onwards) and detail the ways in which Bolsonaro's anti-science agenda is evident in his response to patterns of deforestation and the “burning of the Amazon” in 2019. Second, we explore the politics of Matteo Salvini in Italy, highlighting how, in this form of right-wing populism, the environment has become a container for wider political ambitions. In doing so, this work highlights the complexity of the relationship between contemporary right-wing populism and the environment – and the ways in which populist ecologies may act to conceal the more-nefarious elements of the populist moment.

This paper details how right-wing variants of populism create new socio-ecological patterns of interaction. Drawing on case studies of Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil and Matteo Salvini in Italy, we advance a conceptualisation of “populist ecologies” to explore and make sense of how ecology is represented within far-right populist projects. In doing so, we highlight an important complexity in which populist ecologies may function to conceal broader, more nefarious elements of far-right populist projects.
