The [Group](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/geography/research/historical-cultural/) has a wide-ranging historical focus from the ancient and medieval periods up to the late twentieth century. Geographically, its interests are centred on Britain and Ireland, Europe, and the Eastern Mediterranean. However, concerns with diaspora, travel and exploration mean that studies include considerations of places much further afield, such as the Americas, Australia and Antarctica.

Our meetings are intended to provide an informal space to present, discuss and receive feedback on emergent work. We are especially keen that it be a place for post-graduates to present their work, lead discussions and receive constructive feedback beyond that provided by supervisors.

**We meet Tuesdays 1-2pm bi-weekly.**

The dates for the rest of term are:
* 2nd Nov - discussion lead: Merle Patchett - Fashion’s Earthly Histories: Animal, Vegetal, Synthetic
* 16th Nov - discussion lead: Mark Jackson
* 30th Nov - discussion lead: Leslie Gonzalez Lazcano
* 14th Dec - Christmas merriment (this might be an afternoon/evening session - tbc)

If you would like to get the invite into your calendar, or would like to be part of this group in the future then please email [Merle Patchett](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/people/person/Merle-Patchett-a0f7c88f-1a2e-44aa-9b5c-8b74f5c88cf1/) nand we’ll put you on the HCRG email list to avoid cluttering peoples' calendars unnecessarily.
