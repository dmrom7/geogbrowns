George Smith and Austin Read (both PhD students in Human Geography) are setting up a Political Ecology Reading Group, the first meeting of which will take place on Thursday 11th November at 14:00 (location TBC).

This will be a space for relaxed and informal discussions on various topics loosely related to political ecology and human-environment relations, which might include (but not limited to):
• Political ecologies of conservation and development
• Urban political ecology
• Indigenous rights/ activism
• Decolonial methodologies
• Degrowth
• Post-humanism/ more-than-human geographies
• Political ontology and environmental conflict

The idea of the group is not to create lots more work and extra reading, but to compliment your own research by opening up a space to discuss and share ideas. If any of these topics above relate to your own work and interests, it would be great if you could come along!

In the first meeting we can mainly talk about what we might want to get out of the group, how to structure the readings, and how often and where (cafe or seminar room?) we’d like to meet etc. In order to get the ball rolling though for next week, we suggest we start off with reading the following:

https://paige-west.com/2018/07/28/decolonizing-conservation/ - these are a couple of interesting articles about the role of political ecology in decolonising conservation (by John Aini and Page West)

Please get in touch with George (george.smith@bristol.ac.uk) or Austin (austin.read@bristol.ac.uk) if you have any questions or you want to join
