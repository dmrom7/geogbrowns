GPE is an open and welcoming group, and we hope members would agree in describing GPE as having a broad scope that covers a wide range of topics. As such, anyone and everyone is welcome to attend our meetings, and this should prove to be a great opportunity to meet others within the department. Please do feel encouraged to disseminate this email to anyone you believe may be interested in coming along.

The first meeting will take place on 20th October in Seminar Room 2 from 10am to 11am. There will be a discussion of **“New Class Realities”** from The Asset Economy (2020) by Lisa Adkins, 
Melinda Cooper and Martijn Konings. [Library copy here](https://bris.on.worldcat.org/v2/oclc/1199008422)**
