## Tools for finding availiable room

* [**This Tool**](https://www.bris.ac.uk/where-is-my/find/free-room/table?_ga=2.16953209.1387906137.1632904056-1397940601.1601127812) allows you to look for room availiable in specific buildings for today only, so you can find room availiable for your scheduled meeting.


* [**This Tool**](https://www.bris.ac.uk/syllabus-plus/tt2022/location.asp) allows you to look at the whole timetable for specific room in specific building, so you can find the best time to access you favourite room.

## Dedicated online meeting rooms

The school now fitted out two rooms that are available to School staff and PGRs only, and are deicated for online meetings, conferences and presentation recording.
Room availability will be in [Bristol University | Timetables although](https://www.bris.ac.uk/syllabus-plus/tt2022/location.asp) (one of the tools above).

Both rooms must be booked through the School Office or through Jeni Milsom so that we can restrict access just to the School. If you can't find the room, just approach someone from admin office, the reception in main department or just ask your fellow PGRs to show you around.

* **Basement room B3S** - Has a capacity of 10 people and has board room layout.
* **Old Printer Room 2.22n** - Has a capacity of 10 people (although a bit of a squeeze), has board room layout and very large display screen for virtual meetings.


The school also has a *lapel microphone* that can be borrowed, please ask about it while booking the room.
