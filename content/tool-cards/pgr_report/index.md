## What is unacceptable behaviour?

* **Discrimination** - Being treated unfairly because of who you are or a protected characteristic such as disability or race.
* **Hate crime** - A hate crime is an action or behaviour that is motivated by hostility towards a protected characteristic.
* **Sexual violence and harassment** - Any sexual touching that a person does not consent to. It involves all unwanted sexual contact including kissing, groping, rape, enforced sexual acts, and verbal solicitations or comments.
* **Bullying and harassment** - Unwanted behaviour that is intimidating, offensive or insulting.
* **Domestic violence** - Can include emotional, psychological, physical, financial and sexual abuse in couple relationships (current or previous) or between family members.
* **Physical assault** - When an individual or a group attacks a person physically, with or without the use of a weapon, or threatens to hurt that person.

## How to report it?

If you, or someone you know, have experienced unwanted actions or behaviour or been treated unfairly, here is what you can do.
 
Complete the [Request Wellbeing Support form](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/wellbeing/request-support/): a wellbeing adviser will make contact with you to offer support and advise you about your options. The adviser can explain the options and possible outcomes, and help you decide what is right for you. **OR** [Report anonymously](https://reportandsupport.bristol.ac.uk/report/anonymous): in this case the University will be informed about the incident but will not be able to take action.
