**We are looking for PGR Social Representatives**


We have been lucky to have Viola and Tamsin who organized PGR social events last year. This position is now open for anyone who enjoys organizing parties and social events. This includes organising the summer party, Christmas party and casual meet-ups. Please let us know if you are interested.


**Browns skills sheet**

We have a spreadsheet with information on the skills that everyone in Browns has and is willing to offer help with. It’s currently a little out of date, but if everyone could take a look and either add or update their own skills (your field of study, software, journals you have experience publishing with, languages, random skills...) that would be brilliant. It will then be a great resource for knowing where to turn if we have problems. I hope this will also be helpful to new starters who are looking for help but don’t know where to go at the moment.

Here is the link to the Browns skills spreadsheet, it’s stored on our Sharepoint site: [Browns skills sheet](https://uob.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/teams/grp-ggy-postgrad/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B4910B421-2AC3-4F43-802A-9D94A5456366%7D&file=Browns%20Skills%20Sheet%202021.xlsx&action=default&mobileredirect=true&cid=761906f6-ce1d-4d25-9712-b9dfd4e12c67).
