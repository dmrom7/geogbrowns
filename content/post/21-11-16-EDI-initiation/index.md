The EDI reps team is finally complete, and we are excited to be able to share with you what we are planning for this academic year!

Now that we are gradually returning to more in-person meetups, we would love to see you all more frequently and have informal chats on EDI matters over a hot drink and some treats in the School. 
So, WHAT to talk about on those occasions? We created an [anonymous form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=MH_ksn3NTkql2rGM8aQVG73sKx3fIF1Hrhgnw_P9MpRUME45U01QRldQVDBVSFM4Sk44NVIxV1RKRy4u&wdLOR=c8B8799FC-8EF8-4A05-84B7-7935858E1809) for you to tell us what topics you feel are important and necessary to be discussed either within these socials or with the School Committee more generally. Do feel free to contact us if you have any question or comment on this!

We are looking forward to hearing from you and we'll get back to you soon.
