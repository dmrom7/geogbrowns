Submitting your thesis might sound or feel difficult but it's actually really simple. Just follow these **three steps**.

<!--more-->

## 1.	Convert and title

* Convert the word document to pdf 
* Title the document using the following format ‘PGR_submission_student surname_student first name_student number'

An example with fictional student 'John Smith' with student number 'T 195765' (the one on the back of your student card);
> PGR_submission_Smith_John_T195765.pdf


## 2. Submit

* Go to [BlackBoard](https://www.ole.bris.ac.uk/webapps/portal/execute/tabs/tabAction?tab_tab_group_id=_1_1) home page and find the box called **My Organizations**
* Enter the one that says **Geographical Sciences Human Geog Postgraduate E-submission**
* Submit thesis to Turnitin on the *‘Final submission area’*. Make sure that the file you are submitting is a pdf and NOT a Chrome HTML. 
* If the document has saved as a Chrome HTML use the following instructions;
-	Hover over the HTML Chrome document.
-	Right click it
-	Click Properties
-	Click General tab
-	Click Change type
-	Choose Adobe Acrobat in the list
-	Click OK
-	Click Apply then OK
-	This should reset those PDF files back to Acrobat.


## 3. Email about your submission

* Email the **exams office**(pgr-exams@bristol.ac.uk), Geog Pgadmin (geog-pgadmis@bristol.ac.uk), and your **supervisors** with the document attached and clarify that you have also submitted the document to Turnitin. 
* If file is too big, you will need to create a [Facility for the Upload of Large Files (fluff) link](https://uob.sharepoint.com/sites/itservices/SitePages/fluff.aspx). 


> In case of any problems, ask your peers or email the admin office, happy submitting!
