**Coffee and Cake time resumed from dead!**

> Every Tuesday from 11:00 to 12:00

*Coffee & Cake Tuesdays* is a weekly social hour for all the researchers in Browns (or outside the Browns). 
There will be some free biscuits and hopefully some home made cake from one of us.



If you want to sign up for a **cake duty**, please use [this spreadsheet](https://uob.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/teams/grp-ggy-postgrad/Shared%20Documents/Browns%20Cake%20Rota.xlsx?d=w4538461a6e3c4ec380510bfe09120c54&csf=1&web=1&e=xC2hLV)



The virtual meeting room is still on for those who are not able to come in person. The link should be in your calendar, if not contact one of our Reps.
