** Coffe and Cake time Resumed from dead!**

> Every Tuesday from 11:00 to 12:00

*Coffee & Cake Tuesdays* is a weekly social hour for all the researchers in Browns (or outside the Browns). 
There will be some free buiscits and hopefully some home made cake from one of us.

The virtual meeting room is still on for those who are not able to come in person. The link should be in your calendar, if not contact one of our Reps.
