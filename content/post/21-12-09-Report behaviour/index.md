## How to report it?

If you, or someone you know, have experienced unwanted actions or behaviour or been treated unfairly, here is what you can do.
 
Complete the [Request Wellbeing Support form](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/wellbeing/request-support/): a wellbeing adviser will make contact with you to offer support and advise you about your options. The adviser can explain the options and possible outcomes, and help you decide what is right for you. **OR** [Report anonymously](https://reportandsupport.bristol.ac.uk/report/anonymous): in this case the University will be informed about the incident but will not be able to take action.
