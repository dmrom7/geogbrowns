Join us for the first in a series of special Green Guest Lectures from the School of Geographical Sciences at the University of Bristol. Eminent Professor of Natural Resource Management, Thomas Elmqvist, will be giving this talk as part of Bristol Festival of the Future City. There will be opportunity to ask questions at the end, chaired by Associate Professor Sean Fox, from the School of Geographical Sciences and Cabot Institute for the Environment.
 
**About the lecture**
The concentration of people in urban settlements is increasing and sustainability has never been a more pressing matter than it is today. With land use changing and natural hazards increasing at greater rates than ever, pressures on natural resources and ecosystems present dynamic challenges that threaten the very reality of a sustainable existence.
 
These are facets of a broad suite of sustainability challenges that encompass the urban century in the Anthropocene and meeting these challenges requires transformative solutions to overcome the contrasting and, sometimes, contradictory use of sustainability and the related terms of resilience.
 
Solutions that enable resilience and sustainability can be found at key intervention points for local to global action across city-specific dimensions and these are where we must seek hope if a globally sustainable future is to be realised.
