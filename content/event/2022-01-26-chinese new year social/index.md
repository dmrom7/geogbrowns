Bring your own food and drinks, leave your work for a little while with no guilty, and let's have some fun! This is also a kind reminder that you are allowed to take some time off to celebrate non-UK holidays during the academic year üôÇ

Moreover, as 2022 is the year of tiger, we'd like to find the tigers (born in 1998, 1986, 1974....) in Browns! Please do let us know if you are one! üêÜ
Besides, you can also let us know if you have any beautiful suggestions for the party activities and decorations.  

Please also don't forget to do a **lateral flow test** on the day before coming into Browns.
