Come to the Global Lounge for a workshop on Thursday, 31 March, from 4.30 pm â€“ 6.30 pm and sit down with the University of Bristol students who flew out to help Ukrainian refugees in Poland earlier this month, as featured on the BBC.

**Ask these students questions about their experiences and hear the heartwarming story of a simple origami sunflower which gave the gift of hope, and inspires us all to make a difference!**
Learn how the fundraising campaign, Sunflowers for Ukraine, took its name from a national flower symbolizing hope and peace.

Join in to make your own origami sunflower and sunflower pin, while chatting informally to those who went to Poland. Think of how you can get involved, and help us spread a message of hope to those in need around the world!

Please note: The stories are personal to our students, and are of a sensitive nature. Colleagues from the Multifaith Chaplaincy and Student Inclusion teams will be on hand to discuss support available at the University, to students and staff who might be affected.
