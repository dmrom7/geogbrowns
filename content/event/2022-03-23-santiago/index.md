A PGR Community Fund Event

Santiago Rising, directed by Nick MacWilliam, portrays the social revolt that took place in the Chilean capital in 2019 and which led to a change in the political scene and, in particular, the beginning of a process of replacement of the Pinochet's authoritarian constitution.

Throughout thrilling footage of protests, artistic demonstrations and interviews, the film addresses the peoplesâ€™ demands that questioned the neoliberal model and its effects on the population.

[See the Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrFXeUYmGQ0)

After the film, there will be a Q&A with:

* Francisco Palma, Lecturer in Social Policy UoB and expert in politics, citizen participation and neoliberal governance
* Oscar Berglund, Lecturer in International Public and Social Policy UoB and expert in social movements, civil disobedience, contestation, and neoliberalisation
* and Victoria Rivera Ugarte as chair of the panel.

*At the end of the activity, we invite you to continue the conversation and enjoy some nibbles, drinks and refreshments that we will offer to the participants.*

Participation at the event is free of charge, but registration is compulsory.
