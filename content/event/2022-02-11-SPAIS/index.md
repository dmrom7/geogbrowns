summary: 'For human geographers and those affiliated with SWDTP, the cancelled networking event with SPAIS is back:

On Friday 18th March (Friday after next), the SPAIS/SWDTP networking event returns to bring the PGR community at SPAIS and SWDTP together for pizza and drinks! Come and mingle! Please e-mail Maite if you have dietary requirements! 

Where: PGR hub (Second floor of Senate House, BS8 1TH)
When: 17:30, Friday 18th March

Sadly, this is the last event we will be able to hold. Would be great if this event could continue so if anyone wants to take the reins, please e-mail me or the SWDTP! The events were funded through the SWDTP cohort building fund. The fund is available to all SWDTP students and only involves a short application form. You can find more information on the fund here: https://www.swdtp.ac.uk/collaboration/cohort-building-fund/ It would be amazing to see our event continue or a similar regular event be organised by some of you.

We look forward to seeing many of you there! 
Maite, Ayan, Ellie

On Friday 25thMarch, PGRs from the School of Sociology, Politics, and International Studies (SPAIS) are holding a social event at the PGR hub. We would very much like to meet people from other departments, so would be great to see some geography PGRs there. There will be pizza and drinks!

Please e-mail me (dm18378@bristol.ac.uk) if you have dietary requirements! Would also appreciate it if you could do a lateral flow test beforehand!
