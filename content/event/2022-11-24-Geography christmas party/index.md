**Hohoho! Please join us for a jolly fun Christmas party!**

This year's Xmas party has been booked in on Friday 2nd December at Origin Workspace (40 Berkeley Square). The party will start at 5pm and finish at 10:30. There will be a pop-up bar and the Thali cafe will be providing some lovely Indian food. Everyone will get two free drinks (maybe more depending on the turn out) and I can provide tokens/tickets for these closer to the time. After the tokens have gone, you'll be able to purchase drinks at a reasonable cost. Please take two minutes to fill out the spreadsheet (Link below) so I know who will be attending and what dietary requirements need to be considered.
