Sian Norris will talk the insights that socialist feminism brings to her research on reproductive labour and exploitation. Egle Cesnulyte will discuss how sex work positive feminism influence her research on women’s agency and political economy. Jennifer Thomson will consider the co-optation of feminism through the critiques that feminist scholars, such as Nancy Fraser, have raised against neoliberalism.
