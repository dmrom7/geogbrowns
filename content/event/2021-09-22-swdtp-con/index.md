abstract: "We are very excited to invite all interested social science PGRs to this year's student led and organised SWDTP conference! After what has been very challenging year and a half for all researcher discipllines where research students had to deal with unprecedented circumstances and find ways to show resilience in 'getting through' with their research; this year's conference theme is adaptation in the face of uncertainty. How you interpret this theme is up to you!
  We are looking for abstracts of no longer then 150 words for a presentation of approximately 15-20 minutes. You are also welcome to submit poster abstracts to be displayed at the event. We also encourage creative submissions such as poems, short films, short pieces, and objects. Due to timing, we will not be able to accept papers, but will endeavour to offer spaces for as many as possible, to take part in themed/chaired panels"
