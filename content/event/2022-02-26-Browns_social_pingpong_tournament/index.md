Hello dear PGRs! In view of the current situation in Ukraine, us Reps decided to turn the next social into a charity fundraiser! Of course though we had to make it fun… so buckle up for the ultimate Ping Ping tournament! 🏓 And if you don’t want to play ping pong, you’re still welcome to join us for some charitable drinks and snacks! 

## How does this work?

If you are a player, register for the tournament [**here**](https://forms.gle/KcfhTXCu711kMAus7). The better idea of how many players will participate, the easier it will be for us to organise the order of play. To participate in the tournament we will ask you to **donate £3** to the winning charity. Donations will be all done on the day of the event.

* If you’re not a player just show up! You can buy some tasty **alcoholic and non-alcoholic cocktails** that Lenka and I will be making on the spot🍹. And if you don’t trust our bartending abilities… we’ll provide some beer too 🍻 
* There will also be complementary **snacks, sodas and music** 🎶 
* Throughout the night you’ll be able to donate to our Piggy charity bank 🐷 and if you haven’t done so yet you can VOTE for your favourite charity. We will donate all the money raised during the event to the winning organisation. 
* Information on the charities is down below😉
* **BRING YOUR OWN CASH!** Unfortunately we are not able to do donations by card, so please make sure you remember to bring some cash so you can buy your drinks and participate into the tournament💰 

The best player will gain the title of **Browns ping-pong champion** for the 2022 year, and receive a sweet prize.

Schedule:

* 17:00 - 17:15 registration, you can also [**register here**](https://forms.gle/KcfhTXCu711kMAus7) to save some time
* 17:15 - 18:15 Game time!


## Charity donation for Ukraine

As part of this social, we would also like to generate some cash that will be donated on behalf of Geography PGRs to a chosen charity supporting the current situation in Ukraine. There is a piggy bank already placed in Browns into which you can place your donation. 
You will be able to vote which charity from the following you want to donate to.
