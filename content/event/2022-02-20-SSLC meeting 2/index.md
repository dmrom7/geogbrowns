**The Staff Student Liaison Committee (SSLC) is a mechanism by which students and staff can communicate and obtain feedback about all aspects of the PGR experience. Join us for this year's first SSL  meeting to find out the progress on improving your student experience.**

**When:** 16th March 2-4 p.m. 
**Where** online on teams, link can be found in your calendar invites and in a header of this post (available closer to the date).

The SSLC meeting is an important part of the PGR (post-graduate research) calendar. Chaired by one of our PGR Reps, it hosts a discussion between the PGR staff and PGR students, and aims to;

1. Provide a safe space to communicate any bad or good PGR experiences
2. Inform about any changes from faculty side or the student side 
3. Update on progress related to Education Action Plan (link in bio)
4. Update on progress related to PRESS survey

This meeting is open for all PGRs regardless of year of study, and its purpose is for people to be heard.
