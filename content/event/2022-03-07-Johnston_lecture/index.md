summary: Johnston Lecture
abstract: "On behalf of the QuSS research group, it is a great pleasure to invite you all to the inaugural Johnston Lecture in Geography on Wed 30 March 2022 at 5pm in Peel. We are delighted to have Dr Elizabeth Delmelle from the University of North Carolina talking on 'The dynamics of urban amenities and residential sorting: New insights from longitudinal property listing and mortgage lending data'. Elizabeth's talk will be followed by a reception in the Hepple from 6.30pm.

Ron Johnston was one of the most influential geographers working across multiple elements of the discipline: he was proudly Professor of Geography, not just of a small sub-discipline. During his lifetime he authored over 1,000 publications. While specializing in quantitative and particularly political geography, he ranged widely, even penning an Atlas of Bells (bellringing was a cherished hobby). Awarded an OBE for services to scholarship (2011), Ron also received the Murchison Award and Victoria Medal from the Royal Geographical Society, the Prix Vautrin Lud at the International Geography Festival 1999, and a lifetime achievement award from the Association of American Geographers. This lecture is the first in an annual series to celebrate Ron's contributions and achievements. In particular we wish to honour the help and support which Ron gave to colleagues as they forged their own independent careers as a mentor, collaborator or simply someone offering advice. To do this we invite up and coming researchers each year to present their latest work.
