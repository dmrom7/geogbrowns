**Bonfire and Fireworks, a.k.a. getting tipsy on the mound**

This Friday is bonfire night. Tom Cantellow will be taking some tinnies and heading up ‘the mound’ in St Werburghs at about 6/7pm. It’s a little park up a hill where you can see fireworks all across the city. Knowing the mound’s reputation (crusties), I would imagine there’ll also be a bonfire and all round general merriness and revelry. All are welcome, let Tom know if you'd like to join! BYOBS: Bring Your Own Beers + Sparklers
