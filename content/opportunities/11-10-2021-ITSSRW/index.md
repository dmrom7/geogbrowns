**We are delighted to announce an exciting SWDTP-funded workshop on ‘Exploring Immersive Technologies in Social Science Research’; this takes place in Bristol on 17 November 2021, 10am-4pm.**

<!--more-->

The workshop will focus on how immersive technologies have been used in current research projects across the [South West Doctoral Training Partnership](https://www.swdtp.ac.uk/about/) universities, challenging workshop participants to consider how and if they might engage with these technologies in their own research. It will showcase studies using different technologies including virtual reality, hot spot technology and body motion capture.
 
The workshop will focus on a number of theoretical, methodological and practical questions. There will also be opportunities to participate in workshop activities and to talk to creatives and academics about how they have used these tools in their research and what the challenges are.  

**This event is open to all MReS and Doctoral researchers within the SWDTP Universities- whether ESRC funded or otherwise.** 
As the workshop is highly interactive, we are limiting numbers to 30 in total. Places will be allocated on a first come basis, but everyone is required to complete a short expression of interest form as part of the registration process.
