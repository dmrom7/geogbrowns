The University of Bristol supports Open Research, in all its forms. As part of this, we have an annual Open Research Prize, open to submissions from all researchers (including postgraduate research students) in all disciplines across the university.

Prizes of £100 each are awarded in two categories:

The Open Research Prize applications are shortlisted by a panel of judges from across the University, and entries judged by their ability to demonstrate open research practices, as listed below. 

**Open Practices**

using publication under an open license to disseminate research outputs (this may include a range of outputs – publications, data, software code, web resources, etc.);
disseminating research findings as a preprint, either independently of formal submission to a journal, or as part of a journal’s open peer review procedure;
providing an open peer review of a manuscripts submitted under a formal peer review process managed by a publisher;
creating a public preregistration of a study design, or publishing a study as a Registered Report (https://www.cos.io/our-services/registered-reports);
incorporating open and participatory methods in the design and conduct of research (e.g., using open notebook methods, running a ‘citizen science’ project, etc.);
introducing open research concepts and practices into teaching and learning at an undergraduate or postgraduate level;
creating new tools or technologies (e.g., code, apps) to facilitate open research (e.g., combining or repurposing datasets and other research outputs, or for mining content);
undertaking activities to develop the environment for open research (e.g. engaging in high-profile advocacy, participating in community initiatives, etc.);
publishing a data or software paper.
In addition, applicants must include:

their ORCiD on all applications;
evidence of FAIR data principles (where appropriate);
inclusion of Data Availability Statements in publications (where appropriate).
