* Antarctic Mosaic: An Environmental History of the McMurdo Dry Valley
* Time: Tuesday 12th October, 3.30pm
* Place: LR8, Arts Complex


The McMurdo Dry Valleys are the largest predominantly ice-free region of Antarctica.  Since the mid-1950s this region has become an important centre of scientific research as scientists from a range of different fields have been attracted to the opportunities offered by the relative lack of ice and snow.  The Dry Valleys are claimed by New Zealand as part of its broader assertion of sovereignty over the Ross Dependency, but this claim is not recognised by the United States or Japan, the other countries with the most extensive history of involvement in the region.  Drawing on research conducted as part of the McMurdo Dry Valleys Long Term Ecological Research site, this paper examines the interaction of environment, science, and politics in the history of this unique part of Antarctica.  Although never possible to fully put into practice, interdisciplinary collaboration helps to facilitate a ‘total history’ approach to the to the environmental history of the McMurdo Dry Valleys, which offers new insights and resonates with contemporary concerns about writing history in the age of the Anthropocene. 

Our in-person seminars are typically limited to staff and postgraduate students because of space constraints. However, if you are an undergraduate and are keen to attend this seminar, or any other in-person seminar this year, just drop an email to [Evan Jones](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/persons/evan-t-jones). In most cases it shouldn't be a problem.

Many of the online seminars this year will be delivered by scholars based in other parts of the UK or abroad. These include South Africa, the USA, Canada and Sweden. Online seminars are open to all staff and students at the University.

None of our seminars this term will be followed by on-campus events / receptions. However, for those attending in-person seminars, there will be a chance to go to a bar for a drink afterwards.
