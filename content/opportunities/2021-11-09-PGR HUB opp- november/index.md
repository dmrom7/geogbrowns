### PGR Run Club: for amateurs & beginners

The PGR Hub Run Club happens every Wednesday, meeting outside Senate House. We're open to everyone, but please [fill out this form](https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=MH_ksn3NTkql2rGM8aQVG4BS_GuWM1ZJi6bNW8htDBNUMzZKTzdMQkozQlFWSTgwS0VFNkNGUzNTVC4u) to be added to the mailing list.

### Bristol PLUS Award drop-in advice & information
11 November, 1–3pm
What's the fuss with the [Bristol PLUS](https://engage.bristol.ac.uk/docs/711/Bristol-PLUS-Award.pdf?studentSiteId=4)? The University's employability Award is highly recommended by former PGRs, endorsed by employers and can reward you for extracurricular activities completed during your research degree - from organising seminars & conferences to part-time teaching & publications. Drop in any time from 1–3pm to chat with a PGR adviser about PLUS & how you can apply. 

### Craft Workshop: Colourful Collage
16 November, 3–4:30pm (face-to-face)
Join us at the Hub for an afternoon of mindful making at this Colourful Collage Workshop. We’ll be channelling Matisse and ‘drawing with scissors’ in this relaxed, creative session. This workshop is all about the process and spending some time together. Your finished pieces can be displayed on your wall or turned into cards or gift tags. All materials will be provided but please do gather any magazines, newspaper, colourful paper, or old wrapping paper from your recycling box to use if you wish. Book your space on [myPGR](https://engage.bristol.ac.uk/students/events/detail/612686).

### PGR Career Advice & Info
17 November, 1–4pm
Deciding your next steps after postgraduate research can be challenging. The Careers Service is at the Hub offering employability advice and support tailored specifically to PGRs on Wednesday afternoons, every other week.[Book a one-to-one appointment](https://engage.bristol.ac.uk/s/careers/appointments/app/topic/37?workGroupIds=130&siteId=4) with Peter Evans between 1pm and 4pm (including online consultation), or simply drop in to receive advice with no booking required. Drop-ins are held in the Breakout Space, Room 2.21.

### PGR Film Club
Understanding Minorities & Philosophy: Why do Minorities Matter?
17 November, 7–9pm
This film club, funded by the PGR Community Fund, meets fortnightly in the PGR Hub to show films that shine a light on issues of social injustice and underrepresentation. We screen a thought-provoking film followed by discussion led by PGRs in the department of Philosophy. Learn more on the [PGR Hub Calendar](https://uob.sharepoint.com/sites/bristol-doctoral-college/_layouts/15/Event.aspx?ListGuid=ca03ab02-99e1-4ce0-a45f-3eb8c47b498a&ItemId=90). The next film will be Göran Olsson's Concerning Violence (2014). As confrontational as it is ultimately rewarding, it explores the events of African liberation struggles of the 1960s and 1970s from colonial rule, a scathing indictment of past misdeeds—and a sobering reminder of how far we still have to go. 

### PGR Lunch and Learn
Being a Parent or Carer in Academia
23 November, 12–1:30pm
Lunch and Learn is a new series of informal monthly talks for the PGR community to hear from fellow PGRs and academics on relevant topics, share experiences and support each other. This first session is a chance to meet fellow PGR parents & carers and share tips and experiences of juggling research with caring responsibilities. We will have guest speaker Prof. Albert Sanchez-Graells, who wrote a fantastic blog recently on the challenges for academics be(com)ing parents. Lunch is provided but bookings are essential, reserve your place on [myPGR](https://engage.bristol.ac.uk/students/events/detail/617560).

The PGR Parents & Carers Network will also be having a virtual meet-up at 2pm on Wednesday 10 November. Please email Kitty Webster (kitty.webster@bristol.ac.uk) to join the event.

### Coffee & Cake hour
24 November, 11am–12pm
Fancy a hot drink and something sweet? Come by the PGR Hub for the monthly Coffee & Cake hour. We provide free hot drinks and baked goodies, including vegan & gluten free options. This is a great opportunity to meet PGRs from other schools and faculties. No booking required.
Please note the earlier start time of 11am.

## Festive Fun! Upcoming Christmas Events
