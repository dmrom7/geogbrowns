 Institute of Fiscal Studies (IFS) placement scheme


<!--more-->

Please find [link to the Institute of Fiscal Studies (IFS) placement scheme](calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/r/month/2021/8/1) in case of interest. This would be fully supported (i.e. deadline and stipend extension) if you decide to apply and are successful. 

Also, a PGR colleague at Bristol, researching migration, social media and technology is interested in working in collaboration with DTP members. If those issues overlap with your interests, and you would like to be in touch, please drop email to molly.conisbee@bristol.ac.uk.
