The Spatial Analytics and Data Seminar Series hosts talks, interviews, and panels across a wide variety of topics in spatial analysis. Our events are on again this year, with the first one coming up very soon. 

This is an international showcase to the best scholarship involving geography and data co-sponsored by Newcastle University, **University of Bristol & the Alan Turing Institute**.

From segregation and social networks to machine learning and movement, the Spatial Analytics + Data seminar series is a place for dialogue among scholars united by interest in geographic data & spatial analysis, as well as a platform for cutting-edge methods and thinking in spatial social science.

The seminars feature speakers from a wide variety of academic backgrounds & career stages, and are held nearly every week on Tuesday, 1500 UTC throughout the 2020-2021 academic year.

For more information or registration, please contact the series organizers levi.john.wolf@bristol.ac.uk or Rachel.Franklin@newcastle.ac.uk, and look for [#SAD2021 on twitter](https://twitter.com/hashtag/SAD2021?src=hashtag_click).
