* **[Working With Marginalised Communities: Towards an Ethical Practice for PhD Scholars](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/working-with-marginalised-communities-ethical-practice-for-phd-scholars-tickets-191725685687) – 9-11 November 2021, 3.30pm-5.30pm**
  - A growing number of PhD students and Early Career Researchers have shown interest in pursuing research with and for communities who have traditionally been viewed from an abstract distance if, indeed, they have been viewed at all. 
  - High levels of professional and personal sensitivity and ethics are essential if the researcher is to avoid replicating the participants’ experiences of marginalisation and creating an abstract rather than rich, nuanced picture of their lives and experiences.

  *Note: There are limited places for this training. Please only sign up if you can commit to **all** of the three sessions*


* **Exploring Immersive Technologies in Social Science Research Workshop – 17 November 2021, 10am-4pm**
  - This workshop will focus on how immersive technologies have been used in current research projects across the South West Doctoral Training Partnership universities to challenge workshop participants to consider how and if they might engage with these technologies in their own research. This event is sold out but you can register your interest and sign up to the waitlist at [Exploring Immersive Technologies in Social Science Research Workshop (office.com)](https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=MH_ksn3NTkql2rGM8aQVG8u55zEbkqpIh6XvAEGFobNURFE0NE9MTEhFV1EzQ1I3VVNDWEZFNDJTMy4u&wdLOR=c85761A2F-7D49-4DDB-B2AD-3A75CF6FCB84)



* **[Using the Understanding Society study for longitudinal research on individuals and households in the UK](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/using-the-understanding-society-study-for-longitudinal-research-tickets-195744355637) – 23 November 2021, 11am-12pm**
  - Alexey Bessudnov (Senior Lecturer in Sociology, University of Exeter) will share top tips on getting started with Understanding Society in your PhD/MReS research.
  - Funded by ESRC, Understanding Society is the largest longitudinal study of its kind. It provides crucial information for researchers and policymakers on the changes and stability of people’s lives in the UK on a wide variety of topics.
  - As with most other longitudinal household surveys, the structure and documentation of Understanding Society are quite complex. In this 60 minute webinar on Zoom, Alexey will:
    1. Provide top tips on how the Understanding Society files are structured and how they can be linked and reshaped.
    2. Demonstrate how to work with the Understanding Society files in R.
    3. Suggest possible questions that could be posed by researchers using Understanding Society.



* **[Michel Foucault and Education Policy Study Group]() – Sessions beginning mid-November**
  - In this SWDTP-funded study group, members will analyse the relevance of the work of Michel Foucault in the field of education studies
  - Study group activities will commence in mid-November (over three terms), and are open to both doctoral students and staff across all SWDTP Universities. Each term will consist of three monthly sessions and a half-day “conference” including an external colleague/expert in the field. At the end of the year, the group will organise a one-day event where ideas, debates and questions will be shared, with colleagues from the academic community beyond the study group.
  - If you are interested in taking part please email Antonio (Ono) Olmedo (a.olmedo@exeter.ac.uk) for further information.
