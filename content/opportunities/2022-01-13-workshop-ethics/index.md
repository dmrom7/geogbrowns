Speakers:
* **Jo Evershed**: CEO Gorilla Experiment Builder (https://gorilla.sc/about/) - Over the last few years, we've helped thousands of researchers take their studies online with Gorilla. Through doing this we've spoken to a large number of universities, IT specialists, lawyers and researchers about the legal, technical and ethical requirements when taking research online. In this talk, I'll share with you the main features to look for when evaluating a service provider, so that you can be confident you're online research is safe, secure and compliant.
* **Justin Fidler**: CEO SONA Systems (https://www.sona-systems.com/justin-fidler.aspx) - Taking psychology research online can be daunting. There are a myriad of rules, regulations and best practices for universities and researchers to comply with. On the legal side GDPR and Accessibility are obvious ones. From an ethical viewpoint there's participant consent, anonymity and withdrawal. And on the technical side you'll want to consider data security and data redundancy. To manage this complexity and safeguard grant money, universities often have stringent requirements to ensure they meet all necessary requirements. In this talk, I'll describe the main issues that face researchers taking studies online, how these are mitigated.
* **Nicolas Gold**: Associate Professor, Dept. of Computer Science UCL (https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=NGOLD19) - Undertaking research using online data sources raises a range of complex research ethics issues. These arise from the environment, from the data itself, and the expectations and rights of â€˜participants.' In this talk I will describe these issues in the context of research ethics evaluation, discussing how ethical tensions may be addressed, and drawing on examples from social media and software repository mining.
