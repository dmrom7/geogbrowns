**The Group has a wide-ranging historical focus from the ancient and medieval periods up to the late twentieth century. Geographically, its interests are centred on Britain and Ireland, Europe, and the Eastern Mediterranean. However, concerns with diaspora, travel and exploration mean that studies include considerations of places much further afield, such as the Americas, Australia and Antarctica.**

* Time: 19th October, 13:00-14:00
* Place: Seminar Room 1


These meetings are intended to provide an informal space to present, discuss and receive feedback on emergent work. We are especially keen that it be a place for post-graduates to present their work, lead discussions and receive constructive feedback beyond that provided by supervisors.

This first meeting will be on 19th October, 13:00-14:00 in Seminar Romm 1. this will be catch-up session in which we can discuss how we would like to organise, run, and timetable these sessions for the rest of the academic year.

If you would like to get the invite into your calendar, or would like to be part of this group in the future then please email [Merle Patchett](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/people/person/Merle-Patchett-a0f7c88f-1a2e-44aa-9b5c-8b74f5c88cf1/) and we'll put you on the HCRG email list to avoid cluttering peoples' calendars unnecessarily.
