We have recently elected the PGR Faculty Reps and Full Time Officer team for the next academic year 22/23. You can find out who your PGR Faculty Reps and Full Time Officers will be next year [here](https://www.bristolsu.org.uk/articles/results-elections-2022?msclkid=1fe23fe2a90811ecb7b362e60255daec).

We will be running BY-ELECTIONS for two of our PGR Faculty Rep roles, which remain unfilled, and we are calling for candidates to come forward:
 
***PGR Faculty Rep for the Faculty of Science***
***PGR Faculty Rep for the Faculty of Health Sciences***

If you're a PGR course rep in one of these two Faculties, why not consider nominating yourself for this senior leadership role? [Here](https://www.bristolsu.org.uk/resources/pgr-faculty-rep-role-description?msclkid=667aa9a7a90811ec8815a52924659627) you can find out more about what it involves.
