**PGR Circles are a chance to meet other PGRs outside your research group or School. As a participant you will be put into a small group of like-minded PGRs (based on your signup details) and invited to some informal meetups so you can get to know each other, build connections and hopefully make good friends.**

## More about the scheme 
This opportunity is open to all PGRs, regardless of your discipline or year of study, whether you are a home or international PGR. 
Once you are allocated to a Circle, you'll be invited to attend sessions as a group. The initial sessions will be scheduled and include a theme/topic, but your Circle does not have to follow these. Once you know each other a little better, how you make use of your PGR Circle is completely up to you. 

## How do I join? 
Complete the [sign-up form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=MH_ksn3NTkql2rGM8aQVG7AxpJX3GsFEilUjPIb9qnFUQjdTMDQ5TTZQSkJaVFI1TVZNQkdPWTEwRiQlQCN0PWcu&wdLOR=cCAC762BB-09BA-4D30-B309-27559FC6AA78) to tell us you're interested in taking part in Circles. There are two Circle roles: 
* Participant: Joining a Circle with up to 6 other participants to socialise and create a small community of your own.  
* Host: Every member of the PGR Circle will get the chance to be a Circle host. We encourage Circles to take shared responsibility for organising their meet ups. This could be rotating the role of host, co-hosting or any other set up that works for your Circle. 
Find out more about the scheme on the PGR Circles SharePoint page. 

We look forward to meeting you at the first meet-up.
