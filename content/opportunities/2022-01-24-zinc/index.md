Zinc PhD placements scheme, hopefully running from early May to early August. Zinc can accept applications to that from any student whose funding arrangements include support for an industry placement, and would love to increase the number of Arts, Humanities and Social Science students in the cohort (although students from any discipline may apply). 

<!--more-->

Interns can apply either to work with one of our portfolio companies (all of which are working on issues to do with mental health, healthy ageing or the future of work), or to join Zinc's central R&D team in supporting ventures in the final phase of our current venture-builder mission to [improve the mental and emotional health of children and young people](https://www.zinc.vc/missions/mental-health/). In either case, they will gain first-hand insight into and experience of what it takes to develop a research-led, mission-focused company from scratch, and to build “science-rich” products and services to address complex social problems. Their work will be fast-paced and creative, but research-led and with a strong emphasis on building evidence-based products that respond to social need. 
 
Anyone interested can find much more information (including about applying) on our Workable platform: https://bit.ly/33VJVG4 
 
If students would like to have an informal discussion about the placements, they are very welcome to contact Dr Sal Malik - Sal@zinc.vc 
 
The second opportunity Zinc are keen to recruit scholars for is the next round of the UKRI Healthy Ageing Catalyst Awards, for which Zinc is the delivery partner. These are open to researchers in any discipline who are interested in applying their research insights to the development of scalable products or services supporting healthy ageing. Further information is provided in the blurb below.
 
£62.5k Funding opportunity for researchers interested in healthy ageing

UKRI and Zinc have announced the 3rd funding round for the Healthy Ageing Catalyst Awards. Researchers are encouraged to apply for this £62,500 (fEC) grant from UKRI and 9-month structured programme of support from Zinc, to translate their research into impactful and scalable products, services, and interventions that add quality to later life.
