**Another very exciting opportunity for researchers! We are bringing in VOX coaching for another of their popular workshop on personal presence and confident networking. This is a day long, in person workshop, and will be held on Friday 27th of May at the Wills Hall Conference Centre**

<!--more-->


This is an excellent opportunity to get away from your desk for the day at a nice location and immerse yourself in this training. The previous session we ran booked up very quickly so do please get in touch soon if you're interested. 

A little about the workshop...

Important meetings - whether in person or on screen; encounters with high-powered individuals, interviews, networking at conferences - they all put your communication skills
to the test. This lively and involving course for researchers will provide you with practical approaches to making communication memorable. We’ll look at how you can engage others, hold attention and speak so they want to listen.

The course will enable you to:
• Assess the ways you communicate in formal and informal situations, whether in person or on screen
• Recognise the importance of working with your individual style
• Understand how to read others’ behaviour, behaviour, body language and tone of voice
• Develop strategies for becoming confident and communicating assertively
Sign up by emailing the programme coordinator, Ly Frances (ly.frances@bristol.ac.uk). Places are limited and are offered on a first-come-first-serve basis, so please take advantage of this fantastic opportunity. Further details will be sent out at a later date. 

Please note that these sessions are run by an external organisation and are being paid for by the Faculties of Science and Engineering. If you are allocated a place, it is expected that you will attend.

What previous participants have said about the course:

"I personally felt one day was not enough and wished the session last a bit longer. I would highly recommend this training to research students." - 

" This course was much better than expected. The trainer is really exceptional and I recommend this course to anybody that wants to improve communication and networking skills."

“I thought the course was very useful and fits well will within the prepare for impact programme of activities. I'd say from my personal experience there can be a lot of support for the 'what' of impact but much less on the 'how'. Courses like this one fit into the latter category and for this reason are very useful."
