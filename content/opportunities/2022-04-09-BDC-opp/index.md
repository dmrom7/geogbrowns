Applications have now opened for Research without Borders, our annual celebration of the pioneering work of our postgraduate researchers. This year’s festival events will be taking place in July. 

Organised by the Bristol Doctoral College in collaboration with the University Research Institutes, we are offering you the opportunity to share your research with the public though co-created events, activities, and workshops.  

This year we are focusing on PGRs making new connections and we are encouraging applications from researchers — from across a wide range of disciplines — to come together and work in small interdisciplinary teams with our University Research Institutes to co-produce an event, panel discussion or workshop for the festival around a range of different themes.


Each of our University Research Institutes are looking to recruit around 5-6 postgraduate researchers who are interested in working together to explore the following themes: 

* The Cabot Institute for the Environment - How interdisciplinary approaches are delivering the evidence-base and solutions to tackle environmental challenges
* The Jean Golding Institute - Using data to do good
* The Bristol Digital Futures Institute - Co-created digital futures  
* The Elizabeth Blackwell Institute for Health Research - Mental health


All participants will be able to access a bespoke programme of public engagement training and development sessions to support them to develop their ideas into reality this will include training in: 
* Communicating your research to diverse audiences
* Storytelling
* Creative approaches to sharing your research (videos/animation/social media)

Applications are now open and the deadline for submission is 5 pm on Friday 29 April. Find out more and apply on our [SharePoint page](https://uob.sharepoint.com/sites/bristol-doctoral-college/SitePages/Research-without-Borders.aspx). 

If you have any questions, please pop into one of our drop-in sessions in the PGR Hub in Senate House, on Wednesday 13 April or Wednesday 27 April, from 10 am to 11 am, during our coffee and cake hour.
