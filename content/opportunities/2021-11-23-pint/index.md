**We are planning in-person events for Pint of Science UK which is 9-11 May 2022 and we need your help in Bristol!**

<!--more-->

We are currently forming the Bristol planning team and are looking for volunteers to fill the following roles: 
• Event Manager (find and book venue and speakers, run the nights) 
• Website upload (gather all info for website and upload it) 
• Comms (publicising your event in local area, mailing lists, local radio, social media) 
• City coordinator (bring your team and everything together and connect back to Pint of Science central team who will guide you through process) – we currently have one Coordinator but are looking for a second.  
 
Pint of Science is a great way to bridge the gap between research and the public!
