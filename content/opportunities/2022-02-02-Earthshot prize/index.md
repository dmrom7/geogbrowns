The health of the planet and the health of its people are inextricably linked.

If you have a solution that you think the University should nominate for, we would like to hear from you by 14 February.

We are looking for the most innovative solutions to the greatest environmental challenges. These may be solutions that have been developed in partnership with organisations or individuals in the community, business or other sectors.

As an Official Nominator, we are one of over 250 organisations from across the world, invited to submit nominations, selected for our ability to identify the most impactful solutions across all sectors, from grassroots to businesses. The Earthshot Prize will consider solutions that make tangible progress towards one of the five Earthshots. They should be beyond idea stage, have tested their solution in-field or with target audiences, and are at a ‘tipping point’ for scaling their impact within the next five years. You can find out more about the Prize, our role as an Official Nominator, and the 5-stage process to selecting winners at www.earthshotprize.org

If you would like the University of Bristol to consider nominating your work you are invited to send a one-page internal expression of interest (12 point font) explaining your solution and why it meets the expectations of the Earthshot Prize, to pa-pvcresearch@bristol.ac.uk by 5 pm on Monday 14 February 2022. Those selected by the University will be invited to work with us to develop the nomination.
