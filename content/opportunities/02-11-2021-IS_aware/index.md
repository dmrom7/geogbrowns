* [Islamophobia Awareness Month](https://www.islamophobia-awareness.org/): activities and opportunities to get involved and support this campaign "given that half of all religious hate crimes in the UK are against Muslims and Islamophobia is a form of cultural racism." You can follow @IslamophobiaAM on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.


* [Union Black](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/university/anti-racism/union-black-anti-racism-course/): anti-racism course: a 6-hour online course open to all staff and students organised by the University of Bristol and will be run in twice-yearly cohorts for the next three years, starting this autumn.


* [Reclaim and Empower 2021](https://www.bristolsu.org.uk/reclaim2021): Bristol SU and Bristol SU Women's Network have organised a series of events and opportunities to discuss gender-based violence, gender equality and in particular, consent culture and sexual harassment in Bristol - including Reclaim the Night Map, an interactive map to show where you feel safe/unsafe/aware of an incident.
