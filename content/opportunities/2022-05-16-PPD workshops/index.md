Other notices
 
University business travel insurance update
Due to a change in taxation rules, the University business travel insurance no longer provides cover for any periods of holiday, including incidental holiday added to a trip. This means that you need to book your own travel insurance for any periods of holiday. 

You can find full insurance guidance on the ‘Information for students’ [insurance webpage](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/secretary/insurance/information-for-students/). Contact your relevant Student Support Team for any queries.
