Dear Human Geography/AQM PGRs,

The following opportunity may be of interest.


<!--more-->

The Foundation in Arts and Social Sciences is a one year widening participation programme, aimed at mature students, students from underrepresented backgrounds and those without the qualifications required to access higher education. Students who meet the progression criteria at the end of the programme are guaranteed a place on a degree in the Faculty of Arts or the Faculty of Social Sciences and Law. In TB2 of the programme all students take the 'Individual Project' unit. This unit is assessed by a 3000 word essay on a subject of the student's choosing (usually in the discipline to which they seek to progress for the degree). Students are appointed a supervisor, often a PhD student or an HPT, with whom they have 3 hrs one-to-one supervision. Supervisors are paid a further 2 hours to cover any preparation (which should be minimal) and moderation of the student's final essay (the essays are first-marked by the unit conveners). Supervision meetings are by arrangement with the individual student (we give them guidance on how to manage this), and usually take place in the latter half of the semester (i.e. mid-March to May). 
 
If you are interested in supervising an Individual Project, please complete the following form https://forms.office.com/r/tBHXZp3s40 by 4 March 2022.
