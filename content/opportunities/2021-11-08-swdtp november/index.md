A message from Maite, Ayan and Ellie from the University of Bristol:

After 18 months of pandemic atomisation, we feel it is a good time for the PGR community at SPAIS and SWDTP to come together again.
So on Friday 12 November we are hosting a networking and cohort building event for SPAIS PGRs, SWDTP students and related people. The purpose of the event is to begin building in person connections again after so long online along with some food and drink!

Where: PGR Hub, second floor of Senate House, Bristol, BS8 1TH
When: Friday 12 November, 5.30pm
