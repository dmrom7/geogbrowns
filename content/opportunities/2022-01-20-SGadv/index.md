The [Inclusive Research Collective (IRC)](https://www.inclusiverc.com/) is looking for researchers from all parts of the university to form a steering group to help develop a training workshop series called “Inclusive Research Practice”.


<!--more-->


The series, scheduled for summer 2022, will be an interactive, 6-part series designed to educate researchers from all subjects about inclusive research practices, support them in making necessary changes within their own work and departments, and to help shift research culture at the University of Bristol in the right direction. 

The role will involve advising on the design of the sessions as well as helping to tailor the material to your own research area. This is a collaborative project, and we are looking for people who will bring their own expertise and ideas to the table. 

Your input will be sought at two points in the development process (approximately, at the beginning of February and the beginning of March). We have a relatively tight timeline and so you will need to available around these dates. 

This is a pilot project and so there may be more opportunities to develop these ideas and collaborate further in the future 

We are primarily looking for ECRs and PhD students, though all are welcome to apply.
