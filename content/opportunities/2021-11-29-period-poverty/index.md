**Period Poverty Film Screening and Raffle! (£50 Moltobueno and more!)**

<!--more-->

**5th December, 2021**

Hi Everyone, 
BVDA is hosting a Ladybird Screening and Raffle in conjunction with Sexpression, BOGS (Bristol Obstetrics and Gynaecology Society) and Period Society, with all money raised going to a menstrual hygiene project in Malawi run by our partner charity NAYO (Nancholi Youth Organisation). The project involves raising money to subsidise the price of period products and to improve education of womens health generally. 

On the 5th December we are hosting a Ladybird screening. Also we are running a raffle with great prizes such as a £50 Moltobueno voucher, £20 Co-op Voucher, Cowbee voucher and a bottle of bubbly. All proceeds are going to the period project!

Please see the attached fundraising poster for more info and scan the QR code to buy raffle tickets. Film tickets will be available on the door (no cash is needed). Film tickets are £3 and raffle tickets £2 but any donations are welcome!
