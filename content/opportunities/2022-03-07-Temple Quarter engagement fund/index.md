The fund is managed by the Public Engagement team and you can [find out more information online](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/public-engagement/engagement-opportunities/tq-engagement-fund/). Please discuss your ideas with the team before applying. 
 
Please note - if your idea relates to widening participation and outreach to schools, we recommend that you talk with the [Widening Participation team](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/study/outreach/) for advice.
