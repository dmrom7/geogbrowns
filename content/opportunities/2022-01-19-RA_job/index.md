Dr. Mehroosh Tak and Prof. Barbara Haesler are looking to engage a Research Fellow for 3 months to

a full-time position expected to start ASAP until 31st March 2022. This is a paid position.
To apply or more details please email CV, preferred start date and a short paragraph on your interest
and suitability for this position (up to 300 words) to mtak@rvc.ac.uk.

**Project information**

* The what?
The combination of Brexit, the newly proposed Environmental Land Management scheme replacing
the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and heightened public interest in our local food systems creates
an unique opportunity to shape the UK’s food systems in the coming years. In 2019, the UK
government commissioned an independent review to draw a national food strategy (NFS) for England
and Wales and the devolved nations.
Whilst the NFS has received many accolades, particularly regarding its focus on child food poverty, it
has also received many criticisms. Perhaps the biggest setback to the enthusiasm around NFS came
directly from the Prime Minster Johnson, who dismissed key recommendations of the NFS. One of the
weakest areas covered by the NFS has been the role livestock production and animal sourced-foods
play in creating a sustainable UK food system.
This policy research aims to analyse the reactions and uptake of NFS policy recommendations through
a framing analysis of media and press coverage since its release in July 2021 with special focus on the
UK Livestock System. In relation to livestock systems, the analysis will identify trade-offs between NFS,
post-Brexit trade policies and the upcoming changes to the CAP reform. For example, the new UKAustralia
trade deal that give Australian beef producer tariff free access to UK consumer market– a
post-Brexit trade policy - undermines not only the climate change recommendations of the NFS, but
also side lines UK cattle farmers who will lose access to EU CAP subsidies.
* The how?
Framing analysis - This research will be a qualitative framing analysis of key debates and reactions
surrounding NFS in UK newspapers, media and trade press. Responses of key stakeholder categories
such industry bodies, levy boards, food charities and consumer groups will be captured.
Sentiment analysis – with the help of a Python programmer a data scrape of Twitter Application
Programming Interface (API) data to conduct sentiment analysis using hashtag
#NationalFoodStrategy.
Network building - The RA will build a small pool of effective stakeholders influencing UK food systems
policy with particular focus on livestock system actors. This network will be referred to gain feedback
on the report. Most importantly, this activity will support future policy research and grant applications
in this area. Target organisations include the Soil Association, Compassion for World Farming, The
Food Foundation – that helped write the NFS and for which I am a trustee, Sustain, Land Workers
Alliance among others.
13th January 2022
* So what?
The project will produce a report which may be submitted to a peer reviewed journal. Such analysis is
timely for two reasons. First, the UK Government will publish its response to the NFS in a White Paper
at the end of January 2022. This white paper will mention the UK government’s uptake of
recommendations from the NFS. Secondly, this week DEFRA is finally launching UK government’s CAP
reform policies where it shifts the focus from farming to conservation of land. What implications do
these food consumption, post-Brexit trade and farming policies and recommendations have on the
UK food systems? The policy analysis will address this question.

**Candidate requirements**
* Essential criteria
1. MSc in food policy or related disciplines
2. Knowledge of UK food policy
3. Interest in policy analysis and political economy
4. Interest in global agriculture and livestock policy
5. Good communication skills to organise meetings with stakeholders
* Desired criteria
1. Working towards or completed a PhD in food policy or related disciplines
2. Knowledge of data scrapping using API data
