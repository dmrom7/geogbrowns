**Resilience and well-being in academia,  25 October & 27 October, 9:30 am - 12:30 pm (online)**

**Spotting entrepreneurial opportunities, 26 Oct 2021, 2 pm - 4:30 pm (online)**
How do breakthrough ideas come to life? Our Spotting entrepreneurial opportunities workshop will explore what makes up an innovative mindset, and how researchers harness the social and economic impact of their research. This workshop will help you use your existing skills to unlock entrepreneurial opportunities - this can range from starting your own business, commercialising your research, and pursuing roles outside of academia, to ensuring your skills are resilient to a changing job market.
