The [Festival of Nature](https://www.bnhc.org.uk/festival-of-nature/) is the UKâ€™s largest celebration of the natural world and a fantastic opportunity to showcase your research to a diverse public audience and to develop key skills in public engagement. The week-long festival in Bristol is in June with two UoB activity days on 11th and 18th June based at our Barton Hall micro-campus and the Family Nature Party at Bristol Beacon on 12th. There are several ways to get involved such as interactive displays and workshops. If you are interested in taking part get in touch with the Public Engagement Team (cpe-info@bristol.ac.uk) by Monday 25th April.
