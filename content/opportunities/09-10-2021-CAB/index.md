**Support local businesses to create sustainable change.**

<!--more-->

Climate Action Bristol is a response to the Climate Emergency, providing an opportunity for students and local organisations to work together on tangible actions.

Action plans focus on four areas; **Energy & Efficiency, Travel & Transport, Sustainable Sourcing, People and Engagement**. Through collaboration with student teams, local organisations develop an understanding for inbuilt resilience, which should enable future business development with a sustainable perspective.
