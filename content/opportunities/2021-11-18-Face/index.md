**FACE is seeking new members to join its planning committee for FACE 2022. The planning committee is tasked with, among other things:**
• Sharing ideas on event planning in committee,
• Designing publicity material,
• Managing the website and social medial channels,
• Handling correspondence,
• Ambassadorial work – telling people about FACE, through private social media channels, and
• Building a nurturing community.

**Forever Africa Conference and Events (FACE)** is a Pan-African initiative brought together by staff and students at the University of Bristol. The aims of FACE are to respond to the needs of Black students and the absence of African-centred knowledges in HE. Consequently, FACE provides a space of decolonial, antiracist, interdisciplinary, student-led, validating action. Thus, in our work we stand firm on the words of Imani Perry,  'Blackness is an immense and defiant joy.’

If you would like to join/know more, email Dr Foluke Adebisi at: foluke.adebisi@bristol.ac.uk; or the FACE team at: foreverafrica@outlook.com
