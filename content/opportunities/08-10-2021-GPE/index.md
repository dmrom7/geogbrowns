Hello Geographic Political Economists!

We are hoping to get some fortnightly meetings going for the Geographic Political Economy (GPE) research group, which will hopefully gather momentum and continue into the foreseeable future.

GPE is an open and welcoming group, and we hope members would agree in describing GPE as having a broad scope that covers a wide range of topics. As such, anyone and everyone is welcome to attend our meetings, and this should prove to be a great opportunity to meet others within the department. Please do feel encouraged to disseminate this email to anyone you believe may be interested in coming along.

In light of this, we would suggest we meet next week (week 2, commencing 4th October) for a welcome and catch-up session with a view to:
1.  Meet each other and new group members  
2.  Undertake the necessary housekeeping and admin, such as working out the best time for a recurring meeting
3.  To discuss the content of these meetings – We’ll need a hand with this as we had very few meetings last year on which to go on
4.  To discuss if there is any desire for any more relaxed meetings or social occasions

Regarding point 3, we would suggest the following:
* Workshops – a chance to air and discuss whatever you’re currently working on
* Presentations – for internal/external speakers to formally present their work and take questions. This could take the form of multiple or single speakers per session. We feel it is particularly important for newer PhD students to present as part of this.
* Reading Discussions – reading some salient suggested texts and discussing as a group

An outlook invitation will follow shortly for this first meeting; We are hoping to book a lecture hall, and trying to arrange facilities for people to join remotely should they be unable to attend in person. So keep and eye on your emails.

We also sincerely welcome any other suggestions/questions/requests you might have. Please get in touch with [Tom Cantellow](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/people/person/Tom%20S-Cantellow-fe1886bc-45d1-40ce-ad27-ea0d4d9aa4b1/)
