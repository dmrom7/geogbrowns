The fourth International Feminist Geography Conference will take place June 15-17, 2022. The conference will be hosted online and in-person (at University of Colorado, Boulder, US), includes time zone-friendly programming for India, the UK, Europe, and the Americas, as well as activities at multiple sites including Uganda and Ecuador. The conference (in-person and online) will entail an array of modes of engagement including flipped (pre-recorded with live discussion) paper sessions, roundtable discussions, professional development workshops, mentoring and networking opportunities, ‘in person’ self-organized events, virtual coffee time, and keynote panels. 

With support from the Gender and Feminist Geographies Research Group (GFGRG) and a RGS-IBG Research Group grant, we are inviting applications for a ‘conference reporter/blogger’ over the duration of the conference, with one to two additional pre-conference planning meetings. This post is on a part time basis, for a total of 12 hours (@£16.44 hourly) (Grade one on G6 pay scale). Part time/job share options will be considered within the parameters of the role and budget. 

The ‘conference reporter’ will attend online conference sessions and activities on a ‘roving’ basis and, with guidance from the conference organizing committee, will prepare and post a series of brief reports, snapshots, and reflections from conference events. The reports will be primarily disseminated via a conference blog, which will be hosted on the conference website, with further dissemination via social media. An ability to virtually attend a range of sessions across different time zones is essential. 

If you are a postgraduate or postdoctoral research student and would like to apply, please:
Submit a brief (max 500 words) statement of interest in the position that indicates relevant experience.
Enclose a current CV
Confirm that you have discussed your application with your supervisor/line manager.
Please send documents to Deirdre Conlon (d.conlon@leeds.ac.uk) and Rachel Colls (rachel.colls@durham.ac.uk) with a subject heading ‘Conference Reporter application - Feminist Geography conference’ no later than Thursday, March 10th 2022

Applications will be considered by a panel of the GFGRG committee with an expected appointment confirmed by March 30, 2022.
