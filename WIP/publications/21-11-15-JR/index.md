abstract: This chapter reflects on more than three decades of ‘being wrong’. In so doing, it partly highlights the point that we should expect to be wrong when it comes to research in the social sciences and humanities, and possibly be wrong more than ‘right’. Being wrong is nothing to hide' our ideas need to be exposed to being proved, in time, wrong. Evidently, this is the way in which we get things right. The chapter dwells on four aspects of error, focusing in turn on the methods we use, the theoretical or conceptual framings we employ, our interpretations of the ‘data’ we generate, and the histories we recount. To make the case, the chapter will draw and reflect on field research in rural Thailand.
